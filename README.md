# My default Bootstrap 5 templates

I took these from [this](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9joIM91nLzd_qaH_AimmdAR) tutorial. Hopefully this'll
make my life easier in the future.

Techncially you could go [here](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/getting-started/introduction/) to see it all, but these are my spin/notes on it.

## Layout

- [index.html](./index.html) - is a default template
- [typography.html](./typography.html) - is a typography example
- [buttons.html](./buttons.html) - is a button example
- [utilities.html](./utilities.html) - example of utlity classes
- [containers.html](./containers.html) - example container classes, this is for the default grid system
- [ebook.htm](./ebook.html) - the final example from the tutorial

## Notes for VSCode

1. `doc` TAB - created a boiler plate html in vscode
2. `h1.display` TAB - creates this: `<h1 class="display-1"></h1>` via "emmet"
3. `p.lead.center` TAB - creates this: `<p class="lead center"></p>` via "emmet"
4. `lorem8` TAB - creates 8 words of `lorem ipsum` (`lorem` does a paragrah)
